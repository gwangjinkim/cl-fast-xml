# Cl-Fast-Xml - Fast parsing of XML file - translated package from racket-fast-xml


## Installation

As of now, you have to git clone it into your `local-projects` file of your Quicklisp.
Then, you will be able to quickload it.
```
cd /to/your/quicklisp/local-projects/
git clone git@github.com:gwangjinkim/cl-fast-xml.git

# then start your Common Lisp (I tested only SBCL yet)
(ql:quickload :cl-fast-xml)
```
In hopefully near future, I will have published it in Quicklisp, so that only a
`(ql:quickload :cl-fast-xml)` will work.


## Usage

This I will fill out soon.
